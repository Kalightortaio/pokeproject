# Pokeproject

A react app that utilizes a restful API. The Pokeproject is a somewhat functional pokedex!

## Todo

Fonts aren't working.
Haven't utilized loading mechanics.
Could use some transition animations.
Quite a few warnings from eslint.
Page is not responsive, not mobile friendly.
A metric boatload of Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxErrors in the console, can't be good.
